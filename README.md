# Lapiz
Port of [SiraUtils](https://github.com/Auros/SiraUtil) features to Quest.

### What is Lapiz?
Lapiz is a library that abstracts the more difficult and tedious parts of [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject) away from you, making your life easier. The goal of Lapiz is to make features more accessible, and have Dependency Injection more a staple feature of Quest Beat Saber mods.

### When is this going to release?
Lapiz is nowhere close to stable, and therefore not ready for release. We are still working on implementing [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject) and the other important wrapper and providers.

### I got this installed... Do I need it?
Probably! There might be mods that require it and uses its providers or its features to make their mod work!
